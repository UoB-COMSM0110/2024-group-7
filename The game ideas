Doodle Jump: an engaging vertical platformer where players guide a character known as "The Doodler" ever higher on a series of endless platforms. The game challenges players to ascend while avoiding obstacles and using power-ups, striving to achieve a high score. Our initial idea for this game is to add a multiplayer mode, adding a competitive layer where friends or online players can play at the same time to see who can jump the highest. In addition, new interactive capabilities and enemies that interact directly with players can be added, including enemies that can be defeated and converted into points or beneficial effects.

Challenges: physics engine to handle jumping and gravity, map generation system, collision detection
