# The game ideas

Doodle Jump
Describe：an engaging vertical platformer where players guide a character known as "The Doodler" ever higher on a series of endless platforms. The game challenges players to ascend while avoiding obstacles and using power-ups, striving to achieve a high score. Our initial idea for this game is to add a multiplayer mode, adding a competitive layer where friends or online players can play at the same time to see who can jump the highest. In addition, new interactive capabilities and enemies that interact directly with players can be added, including enemies that can be defeated and converted into points or beneficial effects.
Challenges: physics engine to handle jumping and gravity, map generation system, collision detection.

Bomber man
Describe：Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement. In addition to the main maze-based Bomberman games, some spin-off titles involve adventure, platformer, puzzle, and kart racing gameplay.
challenges：Enermy AI，map generation，collision detection.
