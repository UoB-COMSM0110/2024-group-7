## INTRODUCTION

GAMES CONSIDERED: Crossy Road, Doodle Jump, Downwell, Ice Sliding Puzzle, Bubble Boble, God of Light, Pico Park

Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement. In addition to the main maze-based Bomberman games, some spin-off titles involve adventure, platformer, puzzle, and kart racing gameplay.

### TWIST

Singleplayer roguelite dungeon crawler featuring meta-progression powerups

## REQUIREMENTS

The group evaluated 5+ options and decided to develop a game based on bomberman as it is a beloved classic that is not devalued by simple 2D graphics. The popularity of roguelite dungeon crawlers like [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/appp1145360/Hades/) led us to believe that they wuld make a fun twist to Bomberman.
